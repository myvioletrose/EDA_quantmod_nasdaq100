This project applied the quantmod package and explored the performance of companies listed on Nasdaq 100 since mid-2018. Over 100 charts were instantly created using the script; each chart contained several technical indicators, i.e. bollinger bands, width, Commodity Channel Index, Directional Movement Indicator, Chaiken Money Flow & Volume. This helps to visually distinguish ups & downs of each company when looking at the big picture all together. Originally, this project is a proof-of-concept in combining with the "daily_topic_classification" project in order to see if trending financial news (on Bloomberg.com) or sentiment analysis of a company can correlate or precede/predict stock market performance. These two projects were inspired by the Facebookâ€“Cambridge Analytica data scandal in early 2018.
